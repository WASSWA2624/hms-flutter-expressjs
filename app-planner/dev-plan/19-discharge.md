# 19 - Discharge

## Goal
Complete discharge checks, summaries, instructions, and episode closure.

## Backend Routes To Align With
- `/api/v1/discharge-summaries`
- `/api/v1/admissions`
- `/api/v1/ipd-flows`
- `/api/v1/billing`
- `/api/v1/invoices`

## Implementation Scope
1. Discharge-ready list.
2. Discharge checklist.
3. Discharge summary form.
4. Medication/follow-up/instruction section.
5. Billing clearance indicator where required.
6. Final episode closure.

## UX and Workflow Rules
- Keep this module self-contained.
- Use the shared workspace pattern from `10-workspace-ui.md`.
- Keep short actions in modals where safe.
- Use full pages only for complex or high-risk workflows.
- Show loading, empty, error, forbidden, offline, and success states.
- Respect tenant, facility, department/unit, role, permission, and module entitlement scope.

## Done Criteria
- Discharge cannot skip required checks.
- Summary is printable/exportable when supported.
- Billing clearance is visible.
- Closed episodes are traceable.
