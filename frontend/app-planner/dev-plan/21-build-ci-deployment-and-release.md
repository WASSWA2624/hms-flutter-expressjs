# 21 - Build, CI, deployment, and release readiness

## Goal
Prepare quality gates and build commands for all enabled Flutter platforms.

## Applies app rules
- [`ci_cd_quality_gates.md`](../app-rules/ci_cd_quality_gates.md)
- [`platform_guidelines.md`](../app-rules/platform_guidelines.md)
- [`security.md`](../app-rules/security.md)
- [`dependencies.md`](../app-rules/dependencies.md)
- [`testing.md`](../app-rules/testing.md)

## Implementation tasks
1. Follow [`00-execution-policy.md`](./00-execution-policy.md).
2. Document local quality gate commands.
3. Create CI workflow guidance or config when required.
4. Document build commands for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
5. Note host-specific build requirements for iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
6. Check release config and versioning rules.
7. Ensure production builds do not contain debug-only behavior.

## Expected output
- Build documentation.
- CI quality gate plan/config.
- Release checklist.

## Acceptance criteria
- Format, analyze, tests, generation, and build commands are clear.
- Supported build commands cover every enabled platform.
- No production secrets are included.
