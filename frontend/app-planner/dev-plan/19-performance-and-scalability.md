# 19 - Performance and scalability

## Goal
Optimize rebuilds, list rendering, startup cost, shell performance, and future feature growth.

## Applies app rules
- [`performance.md`](../app-rules/performance.md)
- [`scalability.md`](../app-rules/scalability.md)
- [`responsive_adaptive_design.md`](../app-rules/responsive_adaptive_design.md)
- [`pagination_data_tables.md`](../app-rules/pagination_data_tables.md)

## Implementation tasks
1. Follow [`00-execution-policy.md`](./00-execution-policy.md).
2. Review provider watches for unnecessary rebuilds.
3. Ensure lists are lazy, virtualized, or paginated where datasets can grow.
4. Avoid heavy startup network work.
5. Keep shell layout widgets focused and reusable.
6. Keep shared components generic and stable.
7. Document performance checks for release readiness.

## Expected output
- Performance notes.
- Lazy/paginated list patterns.
- Scalability review checklist.

## Acceptance criteria
- Large lists remain performant.
- Startup remains minimal.
- Adding features does not require unrelated rewrites.
