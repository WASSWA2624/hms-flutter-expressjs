# CORS Rules

Purpose: control browser origin access safely.

Rules:
- allowed origins are explicit and environment-driven
- wildcard origins may not be combined with credentials
- staff and public origins may be separated when risk profiles differ
- only required headers and methods are exposed
- preflight behavior must be deterministic and documented
- CORS failures must not leak sensitive configuration
