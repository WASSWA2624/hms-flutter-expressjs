# API Versioning Rules

Purpose: keep public API evolution safe.

Rules:
- `v1` is the current stable contract
- additive changes may ship within the active version
- breaking changes require a new version and a migration plan
- deprecated endpoints must record replacement, start date, and removal target
- field renames or response-shape changes may not ship silently
- route family names and permission keys must stay stable once public
