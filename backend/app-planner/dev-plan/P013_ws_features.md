# P013 WebSocket Features

Goal: define realtime domain events after core modules exist.

Event families:
- auth and session revocation
- queue and appointment changes
- critical alerts and inpatient state changes
- lab and radiology result availability
- pharmacy order and dispense status changes
- roster publish and staffing escalation events
- maintenance, equipment downtime, and recall events
- mortuary custody, storage, and release-review events
- notification delivery status
- shift close, day close, handover, and closeout progress

Acceptance:
- event names and payload fields stay stable and `snake_case`
- subscriptions respect the same scope and entitlement rules as HTTP endpoints
