# Backend Development Plan

Purpose: this folder is the backend implementation chronology for the target HMS product described in `../app-write-up.md` and constrained by `../app-rules/*`.

Execution order is mandatory:
1. `P000_setup.md`
2. `P001_core.md`
3. `P002_prisma.md`
4. `P003_app.md`
5. `P004_i18n.md`
6. `P005_ws.md`
7. `P006_storage.md`
8. `P007_tests.md`
9. `P008_perf.md`
10. `P009_models.md`
11. `P010_api_endpoints.md`
12. `P011_modules.md`
13. `P012_seeder.md`
14. `P013_ws_features.md`
15. `P014_locales.md`
16. `P015_offline.md`

Chronology lock:
- do not skip forward while an earlier phase is incomplete
- keep module names, permission keys, entitlements, and route families aligned with `app-write-up.md`
- treat multi-role RBAC plus ABAC, unit-manager roster authority, biomedical ownership, Mortuary, `snake_case`, documentation, and script hygiene as release gates, not optional polish

Current repo note:
- the backend already contains broad module coverage, but this plan describes the target reproducible backend, including the first-class Mortuary domain and final doc alignment
