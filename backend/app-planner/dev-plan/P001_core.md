# P001 Core

Goal: build the shared backend runtime and access foundation.

Do:
- implement config, constants, error types, async handling, response helpers, request context, and health helpers
- implement authentication, sessions, permissions, entitlement checks, ABAC evaluation, and break-glass support
- implement rate limiting, CORS, security middleware, audit helper wiring, and structured logging
- define the canonical role and permission catalog used by all modules

Acceptance:
- middleware stack is stable and reusable
- `user_role` plus RBAC, ABAC, entitlements, and break-glass behavior are available before module work starts
- audit-ready helper paths exist for all mutations
